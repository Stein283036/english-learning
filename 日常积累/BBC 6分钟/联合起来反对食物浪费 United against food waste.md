# 联合起来反对食物浪费 United against food waste

Hello. This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.
大家好，这里是BBC学习英语的6分钟英语，我是尼尔。
And I'm Sam.
我是萨姆。
Does this situation sound familiar to you, Sam?
萨姆，这种情况对你来说是否很熟悉？
You reach into the kitchen refrigerator looking for something to eat,
你把手伸进厨房的冰箱，想找点吃的。
only to find a brown lettuce,
只发现一个棕色的生菜，
a sad-looking cucumber,
一个看起来不太新鲜的黄瓜，
and some two-week old fish,
还有一些两周前的鱼，
all past its use-by date -
都超过了使用期限--
the date printed on the food container showing how long it is safe to eat.
即印在食品容器上的日期，显示它可以安全食用多长时间。
Oh, I'm guilty of wasting food, Neil - me and many others.
哦，浪费食物后我有负罪感，尼尔，我和许多其他人。
According to the UN, one third of the food we grow ends up in the rubbish bin.
根据联合国的数据，我们种植的粮食中三分之一最终被扔进了垃圾桶。
And it's not just food that's wasted -
浪费的不仅仅是食物，
it's also the resources used to produce that food, things like water, land and transport.
还有用于生产这些食物的资源，如水、土地和运输。
In this programme, we'll be talking about food waste.
在本期节目中，我们将讨论食物浪费问题。
We'll meet the people trying to stop us from throwing good food away,
我们将看看那些试图阻止我们丢弃好食物的人。
and, as usual, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.
和往常一样，我们还会学习一些新词汇。
Here in the UK, big supermarkets import food from abroad for customers to enjoy all year round.
在英国，大型超市从国外进口食物，供顾客全年享用。
Summer fruit like strawberries and mangos are flown in from tropical countries and sold in winter,
如草莓和芒果从热带国家空运过来，在冬天出售，
increasing carbon emissions as well as waste.
夏天的水果增加了碳排放和浪费。
Yes, that's why you hear the phrase, 'eat local, eat seasonal'
是的，这就是为什么你会听到"吃当地的，吃季节性的"这句话，
to encourage people to buy and eat food which has been grown in their local area, at that time of year.
以鼓励人们在一年中的那个时候购买和食用在当地种植的食物。
So, Sam, my question is -
所以，萨姆，我的小测试是：
which of the following foods can be grown in Britain throughout the year? Is it:
以下哪些食物可以在英国全年种植？是：
a) strawberries
草莓？
b) kale? or,
甘蓝？还是
c) rhubarb?
大黄？
Hmmm, it's definitely not strawberries 'cos they only grow in summer,
嗯，肯定不是草莓，因为它们只在夏天生长，
so I'll say b) kale.
所以我选b）甘蓝。
OK, I'll reveal the answer later.
好的，我稍后揭晓答案。
We've talked about supermarkets in Britain,
我们已经谈到了英国的超市，
but food waste is happening all over the world.
但食物浪费在世界各地都有发生。
In Puerto Rico, too, most people shop in supermarkets,
在波多黎各，大多数人也在超市购物，
making it difficult for farmers to choose what to sell,
这使得农民很难选择卖什么。
and how much to charge for their fruit and vegetables.
以及对他们的水果和蔬菜卖多少钱。
Josefina Arcay is a farmer
约瑟芬娜·阿卡伊是一位农民，
who wanted to make it easier for customers to buy local food.
她想让顾客更容易买到本地食品。
She started an online shop to connect shoppers with farmers directly,
她创立了一个网上商店，将购物者与农民直接联系起来，
without the supermarkets.
而不需要通过超市。
Here Josefina explains her project to Jo Mathys, reporter for BBC World Service Programme, People Fixing The World.
约瑟芬娜向BBC国际频道节目《人类修复世界》的记者乔·马蒂斯解释了她的项目。
So Josefina, that's the farmer who we heard earlier growing those giant avocados,
那么，约瑟芬娜，就是我们之前听到的那个种植巨型牛油果的农民。
she used to have to sell her crops to these kind of middlemen.
她曾经不得不把她的作物卖给这些中间商。
We had a lot of…
我们有很多......
I don't know how you call carreros...
我不知道你们怎么称呼carreros......
it's just people that have a big truck and they will just come by,
就是那些有一辆大卡车的人，他们会过来。
and they will say, 'What do you have? Ohhh… that's too expensive!
他们会说："你有什么？哦......这太贵了！
Wooh… very expensive! I want it half that price'.
哇哦......太贵了! 我想要对半价"。
So I didn't have any way of controlling how I was going to sell -
因此，我没有任何办法控制如何销售--
it just depended on these people coming.
只能取决于这些人的到来。
And a lot of these carreros are kind of commissioned by the supermarkets.
而很多这些carreros是由超市委托的。
All this leads to food waste
所有这些都导致了粮食浪费，
because it's really hard for farmers, like Josefina, to predict which crops they're going to be able to sell.
因为对于像约瑟芬娜这样的农民来说，真的很难预测他们能卖出哪些作物。
Josefina used to sell her food to carreros or middlemen -
约瑟芬娜曾经把她的食物卖给carreros或中间商，那些直接从种植园购买食物的人。
people who buy food directly from the grower,
这些人直接从种植者那里购买食物，
and make money by selling it on to customers.
并通过将食物卖给顾客来赚钱。
Josefina had no control over what to sell,
约瑟芬娜无法控制卖什么，
and a lot of her food went to waste.
她的很多食物都被浪费了。
Usually middlemen are commissioned -
通常情况下，中间商是受人委托的，
they received a payment from the supermarkets directly related to the amount they sell.
他们从超市获得的报酬与他们的销售量直接相关。
But with Josefina's online shop,
但有了Josefina的网店，
farmers get a fair price for their food,
农民的粮食得到了公平的价格，
customers get high-quality, fresh vegetables, and less food is wasted.
顾客得到了高质量的新鲜蔬菜，而浪费的食物也减少。
Another problem is that we throw away food after we've bought it.
另一个问题是，我们在买完食物后就会把它扔掉。
In fact, UN estimates that 60 percent of food waste happens in this way,
事实上，联合国估计60%的食物浪费是以这种方式发生的。
often because it's past the use-by date and might not be safe to eat.
通常是因为它已经过了使用期限，可能无法安全食用。
But according to green designer, Solveiga Pakstaite,
但根据绿色设计师索尔维加·帕克斯坦特的说法。
these use-by dates aren't always accurate,
这些使用日期并不总是准确的。
something she discussed with BBC World Service's, People Fixing The World.
她与BBC国际频道的《人类修复世界》节目讨论了这个问题。
Well, food makers don't know how people will keep their products,
食品制造商不知道人们会如何保存他们的产品，
so for instance, they might forget to put their groceries straight in the fridge when they get home.
因此，例如，他们可能会忘记在回家后将他们的食品直接放在冰箱里。
So what they do is they calculate the use-by date using a very cautious estimate.
所以他们所做的是用一个非常谨慎的估计来计算使用日期。
Food producers and supermarkets…
食品生产商和超市...
they kind of have to calculate it to the worst-case scenario
他们不得不把它计算到最坏的情况下，
because they don't know which product is going to get stored at the wrong temperature,
因为他们不知道哪个产品会被储存在错误的温度下。
so they have to blanket apply a shorter date to protect consumers.
所以他们不得不一概采用一个较短的日期来保护消费者。
Supermarkets set cautious use-by dates for the worst-case scenario -
超市为最坏的情况设定了谨慎的使用日期-
the worst that could possibly happen in a situation,
即在某种情况下可能发生的最坏情况。
for example, someone getting sick and dying of food poisoning.
例如，有人生病并死于食物中毒。
In other words, they blanket apply use-by dates.
换句话说，他们综合了使用日期。
Here, blanket is an adverb meaning applied in the same way to everything,
这里的"综合"是一个副词，意思是以同样的方式适用于所有事物。
even when there are differences between those things.
即使这些东西之间存在差异。
Doing this protects customers from bad food,
这样做可以保护顾客免受不良食品的影响。
but it also means a lot of safe-to-eat food gets thrown away.
但这也意味着大量可以安全食用的食品被扔掉。
Maybe it's best to stick to local, seasonal food after all.
也许最好的办法是坚持使用当地的季节性食品。
Anyway, Neil, what was the answer to your question?
不管怎样，尼尔，你的小测试的答案是什么？
Right.
对。
I asked you which food could be grown in Britain all year round.
我问你哪些食物可以在英国全年种植。
You said kale, which was… the correct answer!
你说甘蓝，回答…正确！
Unlike strawberries and rhubarb, kale grows in all seasons,
与草莓和大黄不同，甘蓝在所有季节都能生长。
and what's more, it's good for you too!
更重要的是，它对你身体也有好处!
OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with use-by date -
好了，我们来回顾一下所学词汇，从使用日期（use-by date）开始，
the date until which food is safe to eat.
指食物可以安全食用的日期。
The slogan eat local, eat seasonal encourages people to buy food which has been grown locally during the current season.
吃"当地的，吃季节性的"口号鼓励人们购买在当前季节在当地种植的食物。
A middleman buys produce directly from the producer,
中间人(middleman)直接从生产者那里购买农产品，
before selling it on to customers for a profit.
然后再卖给顾客，从中获利。
If he is commissioned, he received a payment directly related to the amount he sells.
如果他被委托(commission)，他收到的报酬与他的销售量直接相关。
The worst-case scenario describes the most serious, unpleasant thing that could happen in a situation.
最坏的情况(the worst-case scenario)描述了在某种情况下可能发生的最严重、最不愉快的事情。
And finally, the adverb blanket means applied in the same uniform way to everything, even when there are differences between those things.
最后，副词blanket的意思是以相同的统一方式应用于所有事物，即使这些事物之间存在差异。
Bye for now!
该说再见啦！
Bye bye!
再见！
